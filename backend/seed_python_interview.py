            "A decorator is a function that takes another function or class "
            "as input and extends or modifies its behavior without permanently "
            "changing its source code. Decorators are commonly applied using "

            "An iterable is an object capable of returning its members one "

        "expected_answer": (
            "List comprehension is concise syntax for creating lists using "
            "an expression, an iterable, and optionally a condition. It is "

        "expected_answer": (
            "The GIL is a mutex in CPython that allows only one thread to "

            "management but limits true parallelism for CPU-bound "

            "An instance method takes self and operates on a particular "

            "Exception handling manages runtime errors using try and except "

            "Multithreading uses multiple threads sharing memory and is "
            "effective for I/O-bound work but is limited by the GIL for "
